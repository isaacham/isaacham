So far, I've learned the basic command lines in bash and Python and I've learned how to use different python libraries pertaining to genomic sequencing. However, I am in need of guidance. I am unsure where to start for a project that I am dedicating myself to. I am interesed in looking into various diseases, but the literature is quite loaded with research papers that I do not know which one to replicate. 

It took me a while to accomodate to the bash profile, working environment in VSCode, and familiarizing myself in different Python libraries. 

tldr; I am excited to see where the future lies with these new skills, just unsure where to start.
