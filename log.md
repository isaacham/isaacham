So far, I've learned the basic command lines in bash and Python and I've learned how to use different python libraries pertaining to genomic sequencing. However, I am in need of guidance. I am unsure where to start for a project that I am dedicating myself to. I am interesed in looking into various diseases, but the literature is quite loaded with research papers that I do not know which one to replicate. 

It took me a while to accomodate to the bash profile, working environment in VSCode, and familiarizing myself in different Python libraries. 

tldr; I am excited to see where the future lies with these new skills, just unsure where to start.

I still haven't stumbled upon a project idea. But just recently learned the fields of bioinformatics. I wish I knew the different types before going into it. It is advised to learn programming, how to handle data info, and learn the command line. However, it's difficult to apply these skills without having to know where to start. Bioinformatics can range vastly, from sequence analysis to pharmacogenomics to structural analysis to even predictive models of proteins. 

I've been looking into online forums and browsing through YouTube on how to get started, but I've only found so many places to start. I know the different file formats that you may encounter in bioinformatics, but there are so many tools to work with. Analagous to learning and mastering a programming language before learning another one, I've found that it's useful to be familiar to one field of bioinformatics and hone your workflow. 

With all that said, I do want to move in the field of pharmacogenomics, or drug discovery. While I have been primarily focused and applying myself in the field of sequencing (genes), I was initially curious of Bioinformatics and Drug Discovery. I am also curious in the field of AI and machine learning. I want to combine statistical models as well. Unsure how this will unfold, and cannot say that I am prepared for the uncertainty, I am willing to learn.

tldr; learning ONE programming is akin to learning ONE field of bioinformatics -- get started in one field. i think mine is drug discovery and machine learning.

I had started to use the Drug Disocovery series to uncover a single protein of interest of mine: amyloid-beta. While I had wanted to study hereditary hemochromatosis, there weren't any single proteins that were available. This hinders the parallel learning process along with the Drug Discovery series. Amyloid-beta 42 protein is a popular protein that appears and accumulates during early-onset Alzheimers. Wanted to study the drugs that may target those proteins. Fortunately to my benefit, there were plenty of data that was available in the ChEMBL database.

I haven't been logging my entries these days from sudden schedule changes, but I truly have been learning many different things about learning Python through online resources. There are so many available resources, such as StackOverflow, Videos, and whatnot. I'm thoroughly enjoying the Drug Discovery Data project, and I'm slowly starting to get the hang of using seaborn, pandas, os, matlibplot, numpy, and other libraries. I'm also learning the linux terminal and the command line. Still need to learn how to pipeline in the terminal. I still haven't been able to set a consistent database for github and connect it with VSCode: I'm having to manually upload files. Things are getting more fun, and I haven't been quite self-motivated in a while. I really want to be able to partake in the future of gene sequencing, as well as helping others via drug discovery. Though I'm not fluent now, I will be later.

Has been busy the last couple of days. Sick, taking care of others that are also sick, and meeting up with friends for the holidays/break. Squeezing whatever time I have in order to get hands-on time. While AFK, I've been trying to think about which programs are essential and best for my learning experience. Since I have quite a bit of time before applying, I do want to start on some projects and get them going -- learning that people use AI to basically orient their class structures. Some of these courses are either a) outdated or b) lack co-op experience. I think the best way to get involved is to just start. Just like running, get out of the door and just get one foot in front of the other. While it's nice to get a coach to structure your plans and whatnot, it's much better when the motivation is intrinsic and it's purely self-directed.

Been learning the command line (bash scripting), setting up environments using conda, and downloaded datasets on NCBI database. Didn't realize how powerful the command-line really is. It's so efficient without have to write a code in a text-editor. Getting a better grasp on it now. Using sra-toolkit to install database (fastqc-dump), as well checking the quality score (fastqc).
